React:


Props---> Read-only properties that are shared between components,
	A parent component can send data to a child component.
	<component key=value />

	Types:
	PropTypes--> A mechanism that ensures that the passed value is of the correct datatype.
	
		component.propTypes = {
		   age: Proptypes.number
		},
	defaultProps--> Default values for the props in case they are not passed from the parent component
		component.defaultProps = {
		age : 0,
		}	

Conditional Rendering---> Allow you to control what gets rendered in your application based on certain conditions( show, hide, or change components).
	--> Check the props value, and based on value render the specific values or things want to render.
